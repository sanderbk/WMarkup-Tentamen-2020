        <h3>AC Power</h3>
        <p>
          Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically
          reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in
          contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction.
          Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered
          to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy
          that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances,
          televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket.

        <h3>Inverter</h3>
        <p>
          A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter
          which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a
          photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating
          current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used
          by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of
          system (BOS)â€“component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of
          ordinary AC-powered equipment.

      <article class="h-art h-a-4">
        <h3>DC Power</h3>
        <p>
          Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of
          electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC
          power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but
          can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a
          vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a
          constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A
          term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.[1]

        <h3>Battery System</h3>
        <p>
          Battery size or capacity is measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours). This is
          the amount of energy a battery can store, although the usable capacity
          may differ from the total battery capacity. For example, a lithium
          battery with 10kWh total capacity, may have its usable capacity
          limited to 80% to increase lifespan. Therefore, only 8kWh of energy
          can be discharged on a daily basis. However, often the last 20% is
          available in emergencies, such as a prolonged blackout.

        <h3>Charge Controller</h3>
        <p>
          Solar panels converts daylight into power. With solar charge
          controllers are you able to get the best amount of power from your
          solar panels. The controllers are able to work with different kind of
          voltages 12V, 24V or 48V. The regulators are tweaking the solar power
          with the batteries so you are able to get the maximum battery life out
          of your batteries.

          Solar panels have become more famous the last decade, it is a really
          efficient and profitable source of power and i recommend everyone
          getting a solar panel i'ts not only good for the economy it is also
          really good for the environment. Not only does it give you more and
          efficient power it also provides for aesthetics on your roof. This
          site gives you more information and recommended products to start

        <h3>Victron 175Wp 12Volt Solar panel set</h3>
        <p>
          Solar charge controllers Steca Solarix 2525 and 4040 are newly
          developed products based on the internationally renowned controller
          family Steca PR. With increased module and load current, the
          controllers are now also suitable for even larger systems. The devices
          also feature an integrated USB charging port for charging smartphones
          and tablets. Use of the latest charging technologies combined with
          state of charge determination enable optimal battery maintenance and
          module power monitoring. A large display informs the user about all
          operating modes with the aid of symbols. The state of charge is
          represented visually as a level meter. Data such as voltage, current
          and state of charge can also be displayed digitally as figures on the
          display. In addition, the controller has an energy meter which can be
          reset by the user.
